# Community Content Program

Start9 builds tools for people who want to self-host and take responsibility for their data and communications.

Clear documentation and practical education are a critical part of that work.

Anyone is welcome to contribute videos that support StartOS documentation and real-world use. Contributions are reviewed for clarity, accuracy, and relevance, and contributors may work towards becoming Certified Creators.

Certified contributions may be embedded in the documentation or shared through Start9 channels, helping surface creators’ work to a broader audience, and in some cases be eligible for bounties.

## Video Guidelines

Videos should be clear, accurate, and aligned with the Start9 documentation or StartOS/StartTunnel use cases.

Videos are welcomed in these two main categories:

**Instructional videos**

- Help a user complete a specific task successfully
- Make prerequisites and outcomes clear
- Show how to confirm the task worked as expected

**Exploratory or conceptual videos**

- Explain the purpose or design of a system or tool
- Provide context for when and why it is used
- Clarify tradeoffs or common points of confusion

Accuracy and clarity should always come first. Analogies, comparisons and/or examples are optional but encouraged when they improve understanding.

## How to Become a Certified Creator

1. Pick a topic from the video wishlist.
2. Create a short, focused video that follows the documentation and video guidelines.
3. Submit the video for review.
4. Make any requested changes for clarity or accuracy.
5. Once approved, you’ll be considered a Certified Creator for future submissions.
