# Video Wishlist

This wishlist is based on the current Start9 documentation and highlights areas where video walkthroughs would be helpful.

It’s not meant to be a fixed list. As videos are created, documentation changes, and new ideas come up, this page will be updated over time.

If you have an idea for a video that fits the docs or helps explain how StartOS is used in the real world, feel free to submit it.
