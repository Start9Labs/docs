# Setting up Dynamic DNS

Your ISP may unexpectedly change the IP address of your home.

- If you are using your router as a VPN server for private, remote access, this will cause every authorized client to be disconnected until you re-download configuration files for each client.

- If you are using your router as a gateway for clearnet, domains using it will be unreachable until you update their DNS settings.

To prevent service interruption, you can enable [dynamic DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS). Many routers offer this as a free or paid service. If not, there are third party services available.
