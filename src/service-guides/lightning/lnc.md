# Connect to LND via Lightning Node Connect (LNC)

Lightning Node Connect (LNC) provides a very simple way to connect to an LND node that **does not require the Tor network**.

This is **not** the same as **connecting directly to LND** for which guides can be found [here](../lightning/lnd/).

> [!NOTE]
> This requires installing the [Lightning Terminal](https://marketplace.start9.com/marketplace/lightning-terminal) service from the marketplace.

The following two guides go over how to connect wallets to LND via LNC.
