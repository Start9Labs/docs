# DNS

## Use Case

Here you can view and make changes to the DNS servers used by StartOS.

## Using DHCP

Similar to other computers, StartOS uses the DNS servers provided by its gateway via [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol).

Navigate to `System -> DNS` to see the IP addresses of the default DNS servers.

## Setting Static DNS Servers

To override the default DNS servers and set static ones, go to `System -> DNS`, select "Static", and provide up to three DNS servers, listed in order of preference.
