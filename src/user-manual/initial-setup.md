1. Connect your server to power and Ethernet. If you do not have access to Ethernet, click [here](../help/common-issues.md#i-do-not-have-access-to-ethernet).

1. From a computer connected to the same Local Area Network (LAN) as your server, open a browser and visit <a href="http://start.local" target="_blank">http://start.local</a>.

1. You are physically transplanting your data drive to a new server.
